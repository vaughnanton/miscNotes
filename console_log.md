# console.log()

Most people know console.log(object)
Can also do console.log(msg,values) like sprintf in C or PHP

```
console.log('I like %s but I do not like %s.', 'Skittles', 'M&Ms')
```

will output exactly as you'd expect...

```
I like Skittles but I do not like M&Ms.
```

Common placeholders are %0 for object, %s for string, and %d which is for a decimal or integer.

```
console.log('The state object for %s is %o', "Susan", user)
```

will output the state data for object(user) Susan(string).
