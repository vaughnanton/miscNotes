####Notes on Michael Hartl's **Learn Enough Command Line to be Dangerous**

- If the terminal hangs or ens in a state where it is difficult or impossible to enter commands - use `Ctrl-C` or `ESC`

- Shell, which is the program used to run a command line, will output a list of available commands with the command `man` followed by the name of the command that you'd like to learn about ex. `man echo`

  - to exit the `man` page, you may hit 'q'
