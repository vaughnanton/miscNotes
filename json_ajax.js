//Similar to how user interfaces help people use programs, APIs help programs interact with other programs.

/*
AJAX
-Programmers often use AJAX technologies when working with APIs.
-AJAX originated form Asynchronous Javascript and XML
-a group of technologies that make asynchronous requests to a server to transfer data, then load any data into page
-an asynchronous process means the browser does not stop loading a page to wait for the server's response, also,
the browser inserts updated data into part of the page wihtout having to refresh the entire page
-UE benefits, page loads faster, requests/transfers happen in bg, when new data comes in only necessary part is updated

JSON
-the data transferred between the browser and server is often in a format called JavaScript Object Notation
-JSON resembles JavaScript object literal syntax, except transferred as a string, once received it can be converted
to an object and used in a script
